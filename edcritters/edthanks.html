- Dr. Scully has worked with me to make the Critters! project
a great success. Thank you for all of your assistance over the
years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Critters! was programmed on 400MHz G4, 800MHz
iBook, and dual-2GHz G5 <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">PowerMacs</A>&reg;
in <A HREF="http://www.stazsoftware.com/futurebasic/">FutureBASIC</A>&reg;
by <A HREF="http://www.stazsoftware.com/">STAZ Software, Inc.</A>
and in C++ in Apple's Xcode&reg; IDE. Programming assistance was
provided by Farooq Mela, Craig Plunkett, and Tom Bartolucci. The
OpenGL&reg; game engine was based upon a <A HREF="http://www.lostminds.com/">Lost
Minds</A> game engine by Lars Gafvert (with Chris Stasny, aka.
Staz, and Andy Gariepy of Staz Software) Lars Gafvert contribution
of a basic game engine allowed me to program the core logic of
Critters! in a mere four months! Cheers to Lars!!!! Thank you.
An OS 9 <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">Quicktime</A>&reg;
code example and assistnace with porting the sample to OS X was
provided by Robert Covington of <A HREF="http://www.artlythere.com/">Artly

through in the Critters! project. I especially thank members of
my M.S. thesis committee: Susan Gresens, Ph.D. and Joel Snodgrass,
Ph.D. I'd also like to give a shout out to my teaching mentor:
Larry Wimmers, Ph.D. The Biology Department also provided funds
for my trip to the American Society of Naturalists meeting in
July, 2002.</FONT></P>
